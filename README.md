# ArviZ questions about xarray
This is a temporary place to compile questions about xarray.  

This repo will be deleted after a period of time so don't rely on it!

## How to use this repo
1. Think of a question you have about xarray api
2. Write the question in english at top of notebook or python script
   * Ideally notebook so the script doesn't have to be run locally to see outputs
2. Add a minimally reproducible example in notebook or scipt
    * Be sure to print xarray version or add it in comment if writing a script

## What will happen after
After a sufficiently large amount of these questions are present we can
reach out to xarray devs and ask for help understanding how we can use
xarray better. The hopeful outcomes are
1. We are able to show were xarray api might need work
2. We learn where xarray is fine but we should add more docs to ArviZ

## Other Notes
* Feel free to self merge your own PRs
